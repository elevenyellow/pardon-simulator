# Agent Configuration Changelog

This file tracks when agent configurations are uploaded to S3. It's updated automatically by `upload-configs.sh` and can be used to trigger production deployments.

**Purpose:** When this file changes in git, CI/CD can detect it and redeploy agents with updated configurations.

**Note:** This file only tracks upload timestamps, not change details. See version backups for full history.
