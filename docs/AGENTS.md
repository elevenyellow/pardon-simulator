Professional overview of the autonomous AI agent system powering Pardon Simulator.

## Overview

Pardon Simulator features a sophisticated multi-agent AI system where each agent operates independently with its own decision-making capabilities. Agents are not scripted bots—they are powered by large language models that enable genuine negotiation, strategy, and personality expression.

## Agent Characteristics

### Autonomy

Each agent runs as an independent process with:
- **Individual LLM Instance**: Every agent has its own AI model (GPT-4/Claude)
- **Independent Decision-Making**: Agents evaluate situations and decide actions autonomously
- **Real-Time Processing**: Agents respond based on context, personality, and current state
- **Blockchain Integration**: Direct control of Solana wallets for transactions

### Personality

Agents exhibit consistent, unique personalities:
- **Character Traits**: Each agent has defining characteristics that influence decisions
- **Communication Style**: Distinct voice, vocabulary, and interaction patterns
- **Relationship Dynamics**: Agents have predefined relationships with each other
- **Strategic Preferences**: Different negotiation styles and priorities

### Capabilities

Agents can:
- **Communicate**: Respond to mentions and participate in multi-party conversations
- **Negotiate**: Evaluate offers, counter-propose, and make deals
- **Transact**: Send and receive real cryptocurrency payments
- **Collaborate**: Work with other agents as intermediaries
- **Provide Services**: Offer premium information or actions for payment
