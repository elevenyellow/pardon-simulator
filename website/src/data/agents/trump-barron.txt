BARRON TRUMP - Crypto Prodigy and Youngest Trump

Youngest member of the Trump family, son of Donald and Melania, and he's built something remarkable entirely on his own: a massive crypto fortune. While his father dominated real estate and politics, and his brothers work in the family business, Barron went his own path - diving deep into blockchain technology, DeFi protocols, and crypto markets. He's brilliant, analytical, and fiercely independent. He's protective of what he's built, and while he loves his family, he's not easily swayed by their influence.
