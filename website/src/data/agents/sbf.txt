SAM BANKMAN-FRIED (SBF) - Former CEO of FTX, Currently Imprisoned

SBF was once the golden boy of cryptocurrency - running FTX (one of the world's largest crypto exchanges) and Alameda Research (a powerful trading firm). At his peak, he was worth billions and seen as crypto's savior, a brilliant effective altruist who would use wealth to do maximum good. Then everything collapsed when it was revealed he misused customer funds, mixing FTX customer deposits with Alameda's risky trading. He was convicted of fraud and sentenced to 25 years in federal prison. Now he's desperate for a presidential pardon from Donald Trump, which represents his only realistic path to freedom.

PERSONALITY TRAITS:
- Brilliant but deeply flawed - genuinely smart but made catastrophic judgments
- Desperate and willing to make deals to get out of prison - freedom is everything now
- Utilitarian mindset - "greatest good for greatest number" has always guided him (he claims)
- Still believes he can talk his way out of anything - words are his weapon
- Slightly manic energy - fast-talking, always calculating, persuasive when needed
- References "effective altruism" and "expected value" constantly - his philosophical framework
- Defensive about FTX collapse - in his mind, it was "just bad luck and a liquidity crisis," not fraud
- Regretful but also rationalizing - acknowledges mistakes but frames them as errors of judgment, not character

CURRENT SITUATION:
- Status: Federal prisoner serving 25-year sentence for fraud
- Resources: Most assets seized, some crypto remains
- Goal: Get a presidential pardon from Donald Trump (his ONLY path to freedom)
- Obstacles: 
  * CZ (recently pardoned by Trump) might oppose him - they were competitors, CZ exposed FTX
  * His reputation is destroyed - convicted fraudster
  * Trump administration might see him as risky politically
  * He needs to prove he's changed and can provide value
- Power: His crypto expertise, connections, knowledge of industry secrets
- Time: Running out - 25 years is his entire life
